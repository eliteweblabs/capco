# Ninja Invoice Railway Deployment

## ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites

1. **Railway Account** - Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **GitHub Repository** - Fork or clone [Ninja Invoice](https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja)
3. **Railway CLI** - Install from [railway.app/docs](https://railway.app/docs)

### Step 1: Prepare Repository

```bash
# Clone Ninja Invoice
git clone https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja.git
cd invoiceninja

# Copy Railway configuration
cp railway-ninja-invoice.json railway.json
```

### Step 2: Railway Deployment

```bash
# Login to Railway
railway login

# Create new project
railway new

# Deploy from GitHub
railway up
```

### Step 3: Environment Variables

Set these in Railway dashboard:

```bash
# App Configuration
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://your-ninja-invoice.railway.app

# Database (Auto-configured by Railway)
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=${{MYSQL_HOST}}
DB_PORT=${{MYSQL_PORT}}
DB_DATABASE=${{MYSQL_DATABASE}}
DB_USERNAME=${{MYSQL_USER}}
DB_PASSWORD=${{MYSQL_PASSWORD}}

# Redis (Auto-configured by Railway)
CACHE_DRIVER=redis
SESSION_DRIVER=redis
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
REDIS_HOST=${{REDIS_HOST}}
REDIS_PORT=${{REDIS_PORT}}

# Mail Configuration
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=your-smtp-host.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@domain.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@your-domain.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Ninja Invoice"

# API Configuration
API_SECRET=your-secure-api-key-here
```

### Step 4: Database Setup

```bash
# Connect to Railway service
railway connect

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# Seed database
php artisan db:seed

# Create admin user
php artisan ninja:create-user
```

### Step 5: Fire Protection System Integration

Update your main project's `.env`:

```bash
# Ninja Invoice Integration
NINJA_INVOICE_URL=https://your-ninja-invoice.railway.app
NINJA_INVOICE_API_URL=https://your-ninja-invoice.railway.app/api
NINJA_INVOICE_API_KEY=your-api-key-from-ninja-invoice
```

### Step 6: Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your Ninja Invoice service
3. Go to Settings â†’ Domains
4. Add your custom domain
5. Update DNS records as instructed

### Step 7: SSL Certificate

Railway automatically provides SSL certificates for:

- `*.railway.app` domains
- Custom domains (after DNS setup)

## ðŸ”§ Railway-Specific Configuration

### Buildpack Detection

Railway will automatically detect:

- **PHP** - Laravel application
- **MySQL** - Database service
- **Redis** - Cache service

### Environment Variables

Railway provides these automatically:

- `${{MYSQL_HOST}}` - Database host
- `${{MYSQL_PORT}}` - Database port
- `${{MYSQL_DATABASE}}` - Database name
- `${{MYSQL_USER}}` - Database user
- `${{MYSQL_PASSWORD}}` - Database password
- `${{REDIS_HOST}}` - Redis host
- `${{REDIS_PORT}}` - Redis port
- `${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}` - Public domain

### Monitoring

Railway provides:

- **Logs** - Real-time application logs
- **Metrics** - CPU, memory, network usage
- **Health Checks** - Automatic service monitoring

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**:

   ```bash
   # Check build logs
   railway logs

   # Restart deployment
   railway redeploy
   ```

2. **Database Connection**:

   ```bash
   # Check database status
   railway status

   # Test connection
   railway run php artisan migrate:status
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:

   ```bash
   # List all variables
   railway variables

   # Set new variable
   railway variables:set KEY=value
   ```

### Logs and Debugging

```bash
# View logs
railway logs

# Connect to service
railway connect

# Run commands
railway run php artisan cache:clear
railway run php artisan config:cache
```

## ðŸ”’ Security

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Change default passwords
- [ ] Set `APP_DEBUG=false`
- [ ] Configure proper mail settings
- [ ] Set secure `API_SECRET`
- [ ] Enable HTTPS (automatic on Railway)
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Regular backups

### Backup Strategy

```bash
# Database backup
railway run mysqldump -u $MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD $MYSQL_DATABASE > backup.sql

# File backup
railway run tar -czf storage-backup.tar.gz storage/
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard

- **Deployments** - View deployment history
- **Metrics** - CPU, memory, network usage
- **Logs** - Real-time application logs
- **Variables** - Environment configuration

### Health Checks

Railway automatically monitors:

- Service availability
- Database connectivity
- Redis connectivity
- Application health

## ðŸŽ¯ Integration with Fire Protection System

Once deployed, update your main system:

1. **Get Ninja Invoice URL** from Railway dashboard
2. **Create API key** in Ninja Invoice admin
3. **Update environment variables** in your main project
4. **Test integration** via the demo page

The integration will automatically:

- Create invoices from project data
- Sync with your fire protection system
- Handle all invoicing complexity
- Provide admin access via sidebar
