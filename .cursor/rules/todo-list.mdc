# Project TODO List

The project maintains a TODO list at **`markdowns/TODO.md`**.

When the user asks "what's in the todo list", "show todo", "what's on the todo", or similar, **read** `markdowns/TODO.md` and report its contents. Do not guess or summarize from memory—always read the file to give an accurate, up-to-date answer.
