# Post-Change Site Loading Check

After **every** code change that could affect the app (components, API, config, scripts):

1. **Run the loading check:** `./scripts/check-site-loading.sh` (or `bash scripts/check-site-loading.sh` from repo root).
   - Uses default `http://localhost:4321`; pass a base URL as first arg if needed.
   - Verifies `/`, `/contact`, `/auth/login` return 200.

2. **Report result** in your response: e.g. "Site loading check: passed" or "Site loading check: failed (e.g. /contact 500)."

If the dev server is not running, say so and ask the user to start it before re-running the check.
