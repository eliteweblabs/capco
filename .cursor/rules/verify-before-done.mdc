# Verify Before Declaring Done

**Do NOT say "it's good now" or "done" until you have actually verified.**

## Mandatory Checks

1. **Run the app** – `npm run dev` or `npm run build && npm run start` as appropriate.
2. **Open in browser** – Navigate to the affected URL(s).
3. **Check DevTools Console** – Look for red errors (not just warnings). Zero uncaught errors = pass.
4. **Check Network tab** – No 404s for critical assets (scripts, API calls that should 200).

## When Fixing Production / Live Issues

- If possible, test the same flow locally (e.g. production build + start).
- After deploy: re-check the live URL and console, or ask the user to verify.
- Do **not** assume a fix works because the code "looks correct."

## Shortcuts Are Not Verification

- "The build succeeded" ≠ the app works in the browser.
- "No linter errors" ≠ no runtime errors.
- "I removed the bad code" ≠ the replacement works.

## If You Cannot Verify

Say so explicitly: "I’ve made changes X and Y. I can’t run the app from here—please test and confirm. If issues remain, share the console output or screenshot."
