# Site Config Tandem Edits

When editing any `site-config-*.json` file (e.g. `site-config-rothco-built.json` or `site-config-capco-design-group.json`), **always edit both files in tandem**. They should remain identical.

- Apply the same changes to both `site-config-rothco-built.json` and `site-config-capco-design-group.json`
- Do not edit one without the other
- The two company config files must stay in sync
