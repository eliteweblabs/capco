## Technical Implementation

### Vanilla JavaScript

### AOS (Animate On Scroll) Library

- Uses the same AOS library as the index page for consistency
- Fade-up animations with staggered delays (200ms, 400ms, 600ms)
- AOS.refresh() called when switching steps to trigger animations
- Duration: 800ms with ease-out easing

### Form Data

All form fields are submitted together when user clicks "Create Account" on the final step. The form uses the same `/api/auth/register` endpoint as the traditional form.

### Styling

- **Full-screen layout** with fixed positioning
- **Subtle gradient overlay** (white with 40%â†’20%â†’10% opacity in light, black with 60%â†’40%â†’20% opacity in dark)
- **Backdrop blur** allowing the background pattern to show through
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design
- **Simple Icons** for iconography (mail, user, building-2, phone, check-circle, arrows)
- **AOS animations** for smooth rolling fade effects
- **Centered text inputs** with larger font sizes (text-xl)
- **Fixed login link** at bottom with backdrop blur
