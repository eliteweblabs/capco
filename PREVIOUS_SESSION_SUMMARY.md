# Previous Session Summary - CAPCo Fire Protection Systems

## Session Overview

This session focused on resolving the `NewOrExistingClient` component loading issue in the ProjectForm.astro file, which was preventing Admin and Staff users from seeing the client selection component when creating new projects.

## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. NewOrExistingClient Component Loading Issue

**Problem**: The `NewOrExistingClient` component was not loading for Admin users on the new project form due to:

- Malformed conditional logic in the component usage
- TypeScript import cache issues after case sensitivity changes

**Solution**:

- Fixed the malformed condition from `{(isNewProject && role === "Admin" && "Staff") || role === "Staff" ? <NewOrExistingClient /> : ""}` to `{(isNewProject && role === "Admin") || role === "Staff" ? <NewOrExistingClient /> : ""}`
- Cleared all build caches (Astro, node_modules, dist) and restarted the dev server
- The component now loads correctly for Admin and Staff users

### 2. TypeScript Cache Issues

**Problem**: TypeScript language server showing false positive errors for valid imports after case sensitivity changes.

**Solution**:

- Cleared TypeScript language server cache
- Restarted development server with clean cache
- Component functionality confirmed working despite IDE warnings

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

- `src/components/project/ProjectForm.astro`: Fixed component condition and import

### Component Behavior

- `NewOrExistingClient` component now displays for:
  - Admin users creating new projects (`isNewProject && role === "Admin"`)
  - Staff users in all scenarios (`role === "Staff"`)
- Component provides toggle between new client creation and existing client selection

### Cache Management

- Cleared: `node_modules/.cache`, `.astro`, `dist`
- Restarted dev server on port 4322 (4321 was in use)
- TypeScript language server cache cleared

## Current Status

✅ **RESOLVED**: `NewOrExistingClient` component is now loading and functional for Admin and Staff users
✅ **WORKING**: Component displays correctly in browser despite TypeScript IDE warnings
✅ **READY**: New project form now includes client selection functionality for appropriate user roles

## Next Steps

- TypeScript IDE warnings should clear after IDE restart
- Component is fully functional and ready for use
- No further action required for this issue

## Session Commands Executed

```bash
# Cache clearing
rm -rf node_modules/.cache .astro dist

# Server restart
npm run dev

# TypeScript cache clearing
pkill -f "typescript" && pkill -f "tsc" && pkill -f "eslint"
