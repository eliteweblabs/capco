# ðŸ“§ Email Delivery Test Guide

## âœ… Configuration Complete

Your system has been successfully reconfigured to send emails instead of SMS:

### **Changes Made:**

1. **API Updated** (`/api/send-email-sms`):
   - SMS gateway functionality commented out
   - Fixed recipients: `capco@eliteweblabs.com` and `jk@capcofire.com`
   - Proper HTML email formatting
   - No character limits (500 max in form)

2. **Form Updated** (`SMSForm.astro`):
   - Removed SMS-specific fields
   - Updated messaging to indicate email mode
   - Increased character limit to 500
   - Clear notification that messages go to the two email addresses

3. **User Experience**:
   - Form now shows "Email Mode" notification
   - Submit button says "Send Email to CAPCo Team"
   - Success message says "Email Sent!"
   - Information box explains email delivery

## ðŸ§ª How to Test

### **Method 1: Use the Contact Form**

1. Visit your site's contact form
2. Fill out a test message
3. Click "Send Email to CAPCo Team"
4. Check both email addresses for delivery

### **Method 2: Direct API Test**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4321/api/send-email-sms \
  -F "message=Test email from API - please confirm receipt" \
  -F "contact_info=Test User - test@example.com"
```

### **Expected Results:**

- Both `capco@eliteweblabs.com` and `jk@capcofire.com` should receive:
  - Subject: "CAPCO Design Group - Project Notification"
  - HTML formatted message
  - Contact info (if provided)
  - CAPCo branding

## ðŸ”§ **SMS Functionality Status**

**Currently Disabled** due to Verizon gateway bounces:

- All SMS gateway code is commented out
- Phone number fields removed from forms
- Carrier selection disabled

**To Re-enable SMS** (when you're ready):

1. Uncomment SMS code in `/api/send-email-sms`
2. Restore phone/carrier fields in `SMSForm.astro`
3. Or better yet: implement Twilio for reliable SMS

## ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps**

1. **Test email delivery** to both addresses
2. **Verify HTML formatting** looks good
3. **Check spam folders** if emails don't arrive
4. **Monitor Resend dashboard** for delivery stats

Your notifications should now be 100% reliable via email! ðŸŽ‰
