# VAPI Chat/Form Hybrid - Implementation Complete

**Date:** February 2, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for VAPI Configuration & Testing

---

## 🎯 What We Built

A **hybrid contact system** that offers users a choice between:

1. **Conversational Chat** (VAPI-powered) - Natural dialogue with voice or text
2. **Traditional Form** (MultiStepForm) - Structured 8-step guided form

Both methods write to the same database and are equivalent in functionality.

---

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. Backend Function (Webhook)
**File:** `/src/pages/api/vapi/webhook.ts`

Added `submitContactForm` function handler that:
- Receives contact data from VAPI conversation
- Validates required fields (firstName, lastName, email, phone, message)
- Calls existing `/api/contact/submit` endpoint
- Returns confirmation message to VAPI
- Tracks source as `vapi_chat` in database

**Lines:** 294-365 (new function added)

### 2. Hybrid Contact Page
**File:** `/src/pages/contact-hybrid.astro`

Created beautiful choice screen with:
- Side-by-side comparison of chat vs form
- Feature highlights for each method
- Smooth transitions between views
- Back buttons to return to choice
- Quick example prompts for chat
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop

**Features:**
- Chat container with VapiChatInterface component
