# üöÄ APPLY RLS POLICIES TO FIX ADMIN ACCESS

## Current Status

‚úÖ App running on localhost:4321  
‚úÖ Supabase configured  
‚ùå **RLS policies NOT applied to database**

## Why You're Not Seeing Changes

The SQL files I created are just scripts on your computer. They need to be executed in your Supabase database to take effect.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open Supabase SQL Editor

Click this link: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qudlxlryegnainztkrtk/sql/new

### 2. Apply Profiles Policies (CRITICAL FIRST)

Copy the entire contents of `fix-profiles-rls-policies.sql` and paste into the SQL editor, then click "Run"

### 3. Apply Admin Project Access

Copy the entire contents of `fix-admin-project-access.sql` and paste into the SQL editor, then click "Run"

### 4. Verify with Test Query

Run this query to verify policies are working:

```sql
-- This should show your profile if policies are working
SELECT id, name, role FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();

-- This should show the count of admin policies
SELECT COUNT(*) as admin_policies
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'projects' AND policyname LIKE '%Admin%';
```

### 5. Test in Your App

1. Refresh localhost:4321
2. Sign in as admin
3. Check if you can see all projects now

## What These Policies Do

- **Profiles policies**: Allow users to access their profile data
- **Admin policies**: Allow Admin/Staff users to see ALL projects (not just their own)

## Before vs After

**Before**: Admin users only see projects they created  
**After**: Admin users see ALL projects in the system

The policies exist in your code but need to be applied to your database! üéØ
