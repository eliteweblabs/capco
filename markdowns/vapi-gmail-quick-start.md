# VAPI Gmail Integration - Quick Start

## Is This Possible?

**YES! ✅ This is 100% achievable and NOT a pipedream.**

## What You Described

> "When a new email is received, the agent says 'new email from user@email.com, shall I read it?'"

**This is exactly what we can build.**

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1 (Basic Email Tools) - 5 days

- Day 1-2: Gmail API setup + OAuth
- Day 3-4: Basic email tools (read, send, reply, archive)
- Day 5: VAPI tool integration
- **Result:** "Check my email" → Reads your emails

### Week 2 (Proactive Notifications) - 5 days

- Day 6-7: Email monitoring during active calls
- Day 8-9: Smart filtering (VIP senders, urgent keywords)
- Day 10: Polish & testing
- **Result:** "New email from boss@company.com, shall I read it?"

**Total: ~10 days of development**

## What It Will Do

### ✅ Email Commands

```
"Check my email"
"Read the first email"
"Reply saying I'll get back to them tomorrow"
"Send email to john@company.com"
"Archive this and go to the next one"
```

### ✅ Proactive Notifications (During Active Call)

```
[Email arrives from VIP sender]
Assistant: "New email from boss@company.com about Q4 Budget.
            It's marked as urgent. Shall I read it?"

You: "Yes"
```
