## Subject: SMS Gateway Delivery Issues - Reputation Recovery Request

Dear Resend Support Team,

I'm experiencing persistent bounce issues with SMS gateway emails, specifically to Verizon (@vtext.com) addresses.

**Account Details:**

- Domain: capcofire.com
- Use Case: Fire protection project status notifications
- Volume: Low volume (< 50 SMS/day)
- Recipients: Business clients who opted in for project updates

**Current Issues:**

- Emails to @vtext.com bouncing consistently
- Sender reputation may be affected
- Business-critical notifications not reaching clients

**Request:**

1. **Reputation Review**: Can you review our domain reputation?
2. **Whitelist Request**: Can we be added to any carrier whitelists?
3. **Dedicated IP**: Would a dedicated IP help with SMS gateway deliverability?
4. **Alternative Solutions**: Do you recommend any SMS-specific services?

**Steps Already Taken:**

- Optimized email format (plain text, 160 chars, empty subject)
- Verified domain authentication (SPF, DKIM)
- Added SMS-specific headers
- Reduced sending frequency

Please advise on next steps or if there's a reputation recovery process we can join.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Business]
