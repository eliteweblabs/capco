        representative of lovedtoo ("Exhibitor") AND SCOPE Art Fair Inc, a New York corporation
        residing at 452 Baltic St., Brooklyn, NY 11217, United States ("Organizer") AGREEMENT 1. The
        Terms and Conditions of this Agreement when signed electronically (and any addenda attached
        hereto) using the Organizer's Exhibitor Resource Center ("ERC") shall be the Terms and
        Conditions applicable to Exhibitor's lease of booth space from Organizer regarding
        participation in the contemporary art exhibition in Miami Beach, United States known as
        SCOPE Miami Beach 2024 during the dates of December 03, 2024 - December 08, 2024
        ("Exhibition"). All dates and location are subject to change and Organizer cannot be held
        liable for any changes in dates and or location. Location of the Exhibition hours and
        preview is at the discretion of SCOPE Art Fair Inc. The Terms and Conditions of this
        Agreement shall also cover any additional days required for Exhibitor to move-in and
        move-out of the booth space at the Exhibition. Exhibitor and Organizer agree as follows: 2.
        This Agreement is governed solely by the laws of the State of New York. In the event of any
        and all litigation arising from this Agreement, the parties hereby agree that the sole venue
        for all legal action will lie exclusively in the appropriate Courts of the City of New York,
        New York. The parties agree to waive trial by jury in any and all litigation arising from
        this Agreement. In the event of any arbitration or litigation between the parties under this
        Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs, in
        the arbitration and at both trial and appellate levels. The parties have participated
        jointly in the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
        question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted
        jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or
        disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this
        Agreement. The parties intend that each covenant, term and condition contained herein will
        have independent significance. If any party has breached any covenant, term or condition
        contained herein in any respect, the fact that there exists another covenant, term or
        condition relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of
        specificity) which the party has not breached will not detract from or mitigate the fact
        that the party is in breach of the first covenant, term or condition. The rights and
        remedies provided by this Agreement are cumulative, and the use of any one right or remedy
        by either party will not preclude or waive its right to use any or all other remedies. Said
        rights and remedies are given in addition to any other rights the parties may have by law,
        statute, ordinance, or otherwise. Organizer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, waive
        any covenant, term or condition or the breach thereof contained herein, however, no
        covenant, term or condition or the breach thereof will be deemed waived, except by written
        consent of Organizer, and any waiver of the breach of any covenant, term or condition
        contained herein will not be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of
        the same or any other covenant, term or condition. This Agreement will bind both Organizer
        and Exhibitor and their assigns or successors, and the heirs, assigns, administrators, legal
        representatives, executors or successors as the case may be. This Agreement will not take
        effect and there will be no obligation by either party unless it is countersigned by
        Organizer. It will be effective on the date countersigned by Organizer. This Agreement is
        fully or partially assignable by Organizer in its sole discretion. 3. Whenever notice will
        or may be given to either of the parties by the other, each such notice will be by
        registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, at the respective addresses of
        the parties as contained herein or to such other address as either party may from time to
        time designate in writing to the other, and, if to Exhibitor, such notice will be copied to
        Evan B. Azriliant, P.C, 501 Fifth Avenue, 15th Floor, New York, New York 10017. Any notice
        under this Agreement delivered by mail will be deemed to have been given three (3) days
        after it is placed in the mail with sufficient postage prepaid. This Agreement contains all
        of the agreements between the parties hereto, supersedes all prior and/or contemporaneous
        agreements and understandings and it may not be modified in any manner other than by an
        agreement in writing signed by all the parties hereto or their successors in interest. The
        terms, covenants, and conditions contained herein will inure to the benefit of and be
        binding upon Organizer and Exhibitor and their respective heirs, personal representatives,
        successors and assigns, except as may be otherwise expressly provided in the Agreement.
        Exhibitor acknowledges that neither Organizer nor any broker has made any representations to
        or agreements with Exhibitor that are not contained in this Agreement. All obligations of
        Exhibitor that are or may be intended by their nature to be performed and/or complied with
        after the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement will survive such expiration
        or termination. If any term or provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any
        person or circumstance will, to any extent, be determined by a court of competent
        jurisdiction to be held illegal, invalid or unenforceable, then same will be deemed deleted
        from this Agreement as if never included herein; but the remainder of this Agreement, or the
        application of such term or provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to
        which it is held illegal, invalid or unenforceable, will not be affected thereby and each
        term and provision of this Agreement will be valid and be enforced to the fullest extent
        permitted by law. 4. Unless otherwise approved by the Curatorial Committee, Exhibitors will
        present one artist per 100 square foot of booth space. The Exhibitor is required to present
        a museum hang with 18 inches in between pieces, no stacking of art, no vinyls, and no labels
        larger than 2x5 inches. Exhibitors may only serve food and drink purchased from the official
        event caterers. 5. Organizer does not guarantee specific booth placements, booth
        configuration or booth square footage. Organizer reserves the right to make changes in booth
        assignments, booth placements, booth square footage and/or booth configuration within the
        Exhibition at its sole discretion at any time. The design and placement of booths will be
        controlled and approved by Organizer exclusively, in its sole discretion. Furthermore,
        Organizer does not represent, warrant or guarantee the final square footage of any booth
        space leased hereunder, it being expressly understood by Exhibitor the actual square footage
        of a booth leased hereunder will be unknown until a final floor plan is received by
        Organizer. Should the final floor plan received by Organizer (depicting the actual booth
        size to be leased to Exhibitor) differ from the approximate booth square footage stated
        herein, the final floor plan will control and same will be deemed to amend and supplement
        this Agreement so that the square footage of the booth size depicted in the final floor plan
        will replace the approximate square footage stated herein, and the rental payments hereunder
        will be adjusted accordingly. 6. Exhibitor will make no assignment or subletting nor will
        Exhibitor enter into license or concession agreements or mortgage or hypothecate this
        Agreement or Exhibitor's interest in and to the booth space or Exhibition premises or any
        part thereof or permit any other party to conduct business or manage the booth space or
        control the operation thereof (hereinafter collectively referred to as 'Transfer‚Äù), without
        the prior written consent of Organizer, which consent may be granted or withheld at
        Organizer's sole discretion. Consent by Organizer to any Transfer will not constitute a
        waiver of the necessity for such consent to any subsequent Transfer. Any Transfer by
        Exhibitor in accordance with this section will be only for the purpose and use hereinabove
        specified and for no other purpose, and in no event will any Transfer release or relieve
        Exhibitor from any obligations under this Agreement. Any permitted transferee will assume
        Exhibitor's obligations hereunder and will deliver to Organizer an assumption agreement in
        form satisfactory to Organizer within five (5) days after the effective date of the
        Transfer. Exhibitor agrees to pay Organizer ‚Äòs attorneys' fees incurred in connection with
        the review and/or preparation of any documents in connection with any Transfer, and in the
        event of a Transfer for rentals in excess of those rentals reserved hereunder, Exhibitor
        will pay all of such excess rent to Organizer. Any attempt Transfer without Organizer's
        consent will not be binding upon Organizer and will confer no rights upon any third person.
        7. Exhibitor must be registered and have completed full installation of Exhibitor booths by
        the dates and times outlined in the Exhibitor Resource Center. Each Exhibitor is allotted a
        specific load-in time for deliveries ‚Äì time slots are scheduled online in the Exhibitor
        Resource Center. Failure to arrive for your scheduled time slot may result in penalty, and
        you will be rescheduled for a time slot at the convenience of the on-site operations team.
        Upon arrival to the event, Exhibitor's must first come to the front desk for the check-in
        and to pick up Exhibitor Badges. Exhibitor will not be able to bring in/ drop off artwork
        until the check-in is completed. 8. Only once an Exhibitor's booth is fully installed may
        the lighting adjustment request and curatorial approval request be submitted. Lighting
        adjustment and curatorial approvals are conducted in the order they are submitted. A
        representative of the gallery must be in the booth for these processes to be completed or
        the request will lose its place in the order and be resubmitted at the convenience of the
        on-site staff. Lights will be adjusted to the best of Organizer's ability. 9. Lights are
        installed and adjusted by on-site electricians, according to the exhibitor's specifications
        on their booth sketch. Exhibitors are allotted a one-time adjustment of pre-installed
        lights. This is meant to be minimal and quick adjustment (tilting up, down, left or right)
        of each light. The maximum duration of this one-time adjustment is no more than 10 minutes
        for up to 15 lights, 15 minutes for up to 25 lights and 20 minutes for up to 40 lights or
        more per booth. The relocation of lights beyond the one-time adjustment is not included, and
        can only be executed at additional costs. For safety reasons, only on-site electricians may
        install, move, or adjust electrical connections and lights. Any damages and failures to the
        electrical system, as a result of faulty connections, will be charged to the exhibitor. 10.
        All materials brought to the fair by the Exhibitor must be removed by Exhibitors. Exhibitor
        booth must be returned in the same condition, which it was received. There will be a fee for
        each item mishandled before check-in or left in the booth by Exhibitor after checkout, as
        well as an additional fee for unswept or damaged floor. All material used to hang artwork
        must be removed from the walls and disposed of properly. All labels, letter sets, Velcro, or
        any other material adhered to the wall must be removed. There will be a fee for each item

        event) with a 30-day notice of cancellation provision to the insured and naming SCOPE Art

        Exhibitor also carry insurance to cover loss, damage, or injury to any property of the
        Exhibitor or to any of his officers, agents, employees or contractors, whether attributable
        to accident, fire, theft or any other cause whatsoever. While Organizer may provide security
        guards, it is done solely as an accommodation to the Exhibitor. 3. The Exhibitor expressly
        agrees to save and hold harmless Organizer, the lessor of the Exhibition facility, their
        management, agents, employees, licensees, invitees and contractors from any and all claims,
        liabilities and losses for injury to persons (including death) or damage to property arising
        in connection with Exhibitor's use of the booth space and the Exhibition premises, and in
        connection with security personnel provided by Organizer. FEES 1. Booth fees are billed at
        $75 per square foot. $15,000 for 200 sq. ft. booth, $22,500 for 300 sq. ft. booth, $30,000
        for 400 sq. ft. booth, $37,500 for 500 sq. ft. booth, and $45,000 for 600 sq. f.t booth. In

        400-499 sq. ft, $2,500 for stand sizes 500-599 sq. ft., and $3,000 for 600 sq. ft. and
        above. Exhibitor agrees to pay full cost of booth rental, mandatory charges, and additional
        charges. Additional items will not be provided if payment has not been received in full upon
        receipt of invoice. 2. The balance of the booth rental and additional charges (i.e. less the
        deposit already received by Organizer) will be paid by Exhibitor in TWO equal installments.
        The first of payment is due upon execution of agreement by both parties. Booth placement may
        not be confirmed until after receipt of first payment. The final payment date will be noted
        on Exhibitor's first invoice. In the event Exhibitor fails to make any such scheduled
        payments and/or if any payment due hereunder is delinquent more than five (5) calendar days
        past the due date, the Exhibitor's booth location may be assigned to a non-preferential area
        or any other area at the sole discretion of Organizer and a late charge of $2.00 per square
        foot service charge will be added to the delinquent payment per week for every week payment
        is overdue. Exhibitor may not be permitted to participate in the Exhibition unless all
        balances are paid in full by two weeks (14 days) prior to the show opening date. If
        Organizer allows payment to be made during check-in, a $350 fee will apply. 3. All payments
        made pursuant to this Agreement will be made exclusively in US currency. Payments made
        hereunder may be made by cash, check (drawn on a US) bank or bank transfer (all wire
        transfers must include additional wiring fees). Exhibitor booth invoice reflects a 4%
        discount when paying with cash, check, or wire transfer. This discount is not applicable to
        payments made by credit card. Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express are accepted
        but the 4% discount will be removed. 4. All sums of any kinds and character not paid by
        Exhibitor on their due date will bear interest at $2 per square foot per week unless
        otherwise provided specifically to the contrary herein. If Organizer advances any funds to
        cure any default by Exhibitor or performs any obligation on behalf of Exhibitor which
        requires an expenditure, Exhibitor will be obligated to reimburse Organizer immediately upon
        demand thereon, for all such advances and expenditures, together with an
        administrative/overhead charge equal to 15% of the amount thereof, plus interest thereon at
        eighteen percent (18%) per annum from the date such funds are advanced or such expenditure
        is made. Should Exhibitor fail to pay when due any installment of rent or any other sum
        payable to Organizer under the terms of this Agreement, then, at Organizer ‚Äòs option, a
        charge equal to five percent (5%) of the amount due will be imposed to compensate Organizer
        for its administrative costs in dealing with such late payment. Unless otherwise expressly
        provided herein, any consent or approval of Organizer may be granted or withheld by
        Organizer in Organizer's reasonable discretion. 5. In the event that Exhibitor fails to make
        any payments as agreed herein or breaches any term or condition contained herein, Exhibitor
        will be in default hereunder, and Organizer will have the right to retain Exhibitor's
        deposit and all other monies paid hereunder, and reserves any other remedies it may have in
        law or in equity with respect to any default by Exhibitor hereunder. In the event of default
        by Exhibitor, Organizer will have the right, but not the obligation, to lease the subject
        booth space to another exhibitor prior to the Exhibition. Organizer is under no obligation
        to lease all or part of the defaulting Exhibitor's booth space; Exhibitor will remain liable
        for the full balance due under the terms of this Agreement, together with all costs of
        collection, including but not limited to, all reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and
        interest. In addition to any other defaults enumerated herein, Exhibitor will be in default
        hereunder if Exhibitor fails to observe or perform any of the other terms, covenants and
        conditions of this Agreement (or any other supplemental documents incorporated herein) and
        such default will continue for more than fifteen (15) days after written notice from
        Organizer to Exhibitor. Exhibitor will have seven (7) days after written notice from
        Organizer to cure any monetary default. Organizer will have all remedies available to
        Organizer at law and in equity in the event of Exhibitor's default under this Agreement,
        which remedies are cumulative and not mutually exclusive, including, but not limited to, the
        right of acceleration. In the event of such default, Organizer may recover from Exhibitor
        damages computed in accordance with the following formula, in addition to its other
        remedies: (a) any unpaid rent and other sums due under this Agreement which have been earned
        at the time of such default or termination; plus (b) the unpaid rent and other sums due
        under this Agreement for the balance of the term after the time of default; plus (c) any
        other amount necessary to compensate Organizer for all the detriment caused by Exhibitor's
        failure to perform its obligation under this Agreement or which in the ordinary course of
        things would be likely to result therefrom, including, attorneys' fees and costs; plus (d)
        at Organizer's election, such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as
        may be permitted from time to time by the laws of the State of New York; plus (e) interest,
        the maximum amount permitted by law. In the event of default by Exhibitor, Exhibitor shall
        remain liable for the full balance under the terms of the Agreement together with all costs
        of collection including, but not limited to, all reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and
        interest. Any deposit remitted will be credited toward full payment of the agreement fees.
        However, if Exhibitor has an outstanding balance from a previous event or publication, such
        deposit and /or any payments received hereunder will be applied first to the oldest
        outstanding balance and the remainder to current application fees. Exhibitor remains
        responsible to pay the entire amount of this Agreement. CONFIDENTIALITY 1. Exhibitor will
        consider as confidential any and all information it receives in tangible form from Organizer
        that is marked as Confidential or Proprietary and will use only for the purposes set forth
        above. Information which is disclosed orally will be considered confidential information if
        it is reduced to writing and sent to the receiving party within two weeks of the disclosure.
        Exhibitor agrees to receive and maintain all information in strictest confidence using care
        except as provided herein and will not use information for own benefit or disclose it to
        third parties without written consent of Organizer or use such information in a manner
        competitive to Organizer. 2. All financial agreements between Exhibitor and Organizer are
        solely between Exhibitor and Organizer and are considered confidential. Any breach of
        confidentiality will result in legal action. INDEMNITY 1. Exhibitor agrees to indemnify and
        hold Organizer, its employees, agents, invitees, licensees and contractors, and the lessor
        of the Exhibition facility, harmless for any claims arising out of negligence of Exhibitor,
        its agents, or employees. In addition to the foregoing, Exhibitor agrees to indemnify and
        save Organizer harmless from and against any and all claims and demands for, or in
        connection with, any accident, injury or damage whatsoever caused by any person or property
        arising directly or indirectly, out of the business conducted in or the use and/or occupancy
        of the Exhibition premises, booth space or any part thereof, or arising directly or
        indirectly, from any act or omission of Exhibitor or any concessionaire or sub-exhibitor or
        their respective licensees, servants, agents, employees, contractors or invitees, and from
        and against any and all cost, expense and liabilities incurred in connection with any such
        claims and/or proceedings brought thereon. The general liability coverage maintained by
        Exhibitor pursuant to this Agreement will specifically insure the contractual obligation of
        Exhibitor as set forth in this section and/or as provided in this Agreement. 2. The
        liability of Organizer for failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement is
        limited to a refund of the Exhibitor's deposits paid hereunder. In the event the Organizer
        will be in default hereunder in any respect, such default will not give rise to any rights
        or remedies to Exhibitor unless and until such default will continue for more than thirty
        (30) days after Organizer's actual receipt of written notice thereof from Exhibitor (or, as
        to defaults not susceptible of being cured within such thirty day period, Organizer fails to
        commence the cure thereof within such period and thereafter diligently prosecute the same to
        completion). Further, if Organizer is delayed or prevented from performing any of its
        obligations under this Agreement by reason of strike or labor troubles or any cause
        whatsoever beyond Organizer's control, the period of such delay or such prevention will be
        deemed added to the time herein provided for the performance of any such obligation by
        Organizer in its sole discretion, may cancel this Agreement and the parties hereto will be
        released of all further obligations and liabilities each may have to the other. 3. This

          It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of
          a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
