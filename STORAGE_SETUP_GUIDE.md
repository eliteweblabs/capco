2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Storage** in the left sidebar

### 2. Create Storage Bucket

1. Click **"New bucket"** button
2. Enter bucket name: `project-documents`
3. Set **Public bucket** to **OFF** (for security)
4. Click **"Create bucket"**

### 3. Configure Bucket Settings

1. Click on the `project-documents` bucket
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Ensure **Public bucket** is **OFF**
4. Set **File size limit** to **50MB** (or your preferred limit)
5. Set **Allowed MIME types** to include:
   - `application/pdf`
   - `image/*`
   - `video/*`
   - `audio/*`
   - `text/*`
   - `application/msword`
   - `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`

2. Copy and paste the contents of `setup-storage-and-files.sql`
3. Click **"Run"** to execute the script

### 5. Verify Setup

1. Visit `/api/debug-storage` in your application
2. Check that all diagnostics pass
3. Try uploading a test file

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Bucket not found" error

**Solution:**
- Ensure bucket name is exactly `project-documents` (case-sensitive)
- Check that bucket was created successfully in Storage dashboard

### Issue: "Permission denied" error

**Solution:**
- Run the SQL script to create storage policies
- Ensure user is authenticated
- Check RLS policies are properly configured

### Issue: "File type not allowed" error

**Solution:**

- Check file type validation in upload API

### Issue: "Storage access error"

**Solution:**

- Check that storage policies allow authenticated access
- Ensure user has proper role permissions

## ðŸ“Š Verification Commands

After setup, you can verify everything works:

```bash
# Check storage bucket exists
curl -X GET "https://your-project.supabase.co/storage/v1/bucket/project-documents" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"

# Check files table exists
curl -X GET "https://your-project.supabase.co/rest/v1/files?select=*&limit=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"
```
